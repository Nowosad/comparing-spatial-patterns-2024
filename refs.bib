Hypothesis-driven experiments were designed to determine the cause. Results The cause was demonstrated to be the generalization technique for generating the macrostate of a landscape gradient, which is called resampling. A different computational method was developed on the basis of an alternative technique (i.e., aggregation). Conclusions Validation of its thermodynamic consistency is necessary even if a ``thermodynamic'' entropy is computed strictly according to the formula. The entropy computed using the aggregation-based method passed the validation and is recommended to be used in linking landscape ecological processes with statistical thermodynamics.},

Accompanying the growth of the imagery database is the increase in the number of image-derived products, such as, for example, high resolution, large spatial extent maps of land cover/land use (LCLU). QBIC-like tools for exploration and mining of such products would significantly enhance their value. In this letter we present a method for retrieval of alike scenes from a category-valued geospatial database of which a LCLU map is a particular example. Alikeness between the two scenes is tantamount to similarity between their spatial patterns of class labels. Our method works on the principle of queryby-example, its input is a reference scene and its output is a similarity map indicating a degree of alikeness between a location on the map and the reference. The two core components of the method are: scene signature - an encapsulation of the scene pattern by means of probability distribution of class labels and the sizes of the patches they form, and scene similarity - a mutual information-based function that assigns a level of similarity between any two scenes based on their signatures. The method is described in detail and applied to the National Land Cover Dataset 2006 (NLCD2006). Two examples of queries on this dataset are presented and discussed. The applicability of the method to other datasets is discussed.},

Yet, there is no agreed procedure for doing that, probably because different problems require different algorithms. We explored a variety of existing algorithms and modified some of them to compare grid-based maps with categorical attributes. A new algorithm based on the ``expanding window'' approach was developed and compared to other known algorithms. The goal was to offer simple and flexible procedures for comparing spatial patterns in grid based maps that do not take into consideration object shapes and sizes of the maps. The difference between maps was characterized by three values: quantity, location, and distance between corresponding categories in the maps. Combinations of these indices work as good criteria to quantify differences between maps. A web-based survey was set up, in which participants were asked to grade the similarity of ten pairs of maps. These results were then used to compare how well the various algorithms can perform relative to the visual comparisons obtained; they were also used to calibrate existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {The comparison of spatial patterns is a fundamental task in geography and quantitative spatial modelling. With the growth of data being collected with a geospatial element, we are witnessing an increased interest in analyses requiring spatial pattern comparisons (e.g., model assessment and change analysis). In this paper, we review quantitative techniques for comparing spatial patterns, examining key methodological approaches developed both within and beyond the field of geography. We highlight the key challenges using examples from widely known datasets from the spatial analysis literature. Through these examples, we identify a problematic dichotomy between spatial pattern and process---a widespread issue in the age of big geospatial data. Further, we identify the role of complex topology, the interdependence of spatial configuration and composition, and spatial scale as key (research) challenges. Several areas ripe for geographic research are discussed to establish a consolidated research agenda for spatial pattern comparison grounded in quantitative geography. Hierarchical scaling and the modifiable areal unit problem are highlighted as ideas which can be exploited to identify pattern similarities across spatial and temporal scales. Increased use of ``time-aware'' comparisons of spatial processes are suggested, which properly account for spatial evolution and pattern formation. Simulation-based inference is identified as particularly promising for integrating spatial pattern comparison into existing modelling frameworks. To date, the literature on spatial pattern comparison has been fragmented, and we hope this work will provide a basis for others to build on in future studies.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known for their ability to learn shape and texture descriptors useful for object detection, pattern recognition, and classification problems. Deeper layer filters of CNN generally learn global image information vital for whole-scene or object discrimination. In landscape pattern comparison, however, dense localized information encoded in shallow layers can contain discriminative information for characterizing changes across image local regions but are often lost in the deeper and non-spatial fully connected layers. Such localized features hold potential for identifying, as well as characterizing, process--pattern change across space and time. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective texture-based CNN (Tex-CNN) via a feature concatenation framework which results in capturing and learning texture descriptors. The traditional CNN architecture was adopted as a baseline for assessing the performance of Tex-CNN. We utilized 75\% and 25\% of the image data for model training and validation, respectively. To test the models' generalization, we used a separate set of imagery from the Aerial Imagery Dataset (AID) and Sentinel-2 for model development and independent validation. The classical CNN and the Tex-CNN classification accuracies in the AID were 91.67\% and 96.33\%, respectively. Tex-CNN accuracy was either on par with or outcompeted state-of-the-art methods. Independent validation on Sentinel-2 data had good performance for most scene types but had difficulty discriminating farm scenes, likely due to geometric generalization of discriminative features at the coarser scale. In both datasets, the Tex-CNN outperformed the classical CNN architecture. Using the Tex-CNN, gradient-based spatial attention maps (feature maps) which contain discriminative pattern information are extracted and subsequently employed for mapping landscape similarity. To enhance the discriminative capacity of the feature maps, we further perform spatial filtering, using PCA and select eigen maps with the top eigen values. We show that CNN feature maps provide descriptors capable of characterizing and quantifying landscape (dis)similarity. Using the feature maps histogram of oriented gradient vectors and computing their Earth Movers Distances, our method effectively identified similar landscape types with over 60\% of target-reference scene comparisons showing smaller Earth Movers Distance (EMD) (e.g., 0.01), while different landscape types tended to show large EMD (e.g., 0.05) in the benchmark AID. We hope this proposal will inspire further research into the use of CNN layer feature maps in landscape similarity assessment, as well as in change detection.},

  abstract = {Landscape similarity search involves finding landscapes from among a large collection that are similar to a query landscape. An example of such collection is a large land cover map subdivided into a grid of smaller local landscapes, a query is a local landscape of interest, and the task is to find other local landscapes within a map which are perceptually similar to the query. Landscape search and the related task of pattern-based regionalization, requires a measure of similarity -- a function which quantifies the level of likeness between two landscapes. The standard approach is to use the Euclidean distance between vectors of landscape metrics derived from the two landscapes, but no in-depth analysis of this approach has been conducted. In this paper we investigate the performance of different implementations of the standard similarity measure. Five different implementations are tested against each other and against a control similarity measure based on histograms of class co-occurrence features and the Jensen--Shannon divergence. Testing consists of a series of numerical experiments combined with visual assessments on a set of 400 3km-scale landscapes. Based on the cases where visual assessment provides definitive answer, we have determined that the standard similarity measure is sensitive to the way landscape metrics are normalized and, additionally, to whether weights aimed at controlling the relative contribution of landscape composition vs. configuration are used. The standard measure achieves the best performance when metrics are normalized using their extreme values extracted from all possible landscapes, not just the landscapes in the given collection, and when weights are assigned so the combined influence of composition metrics on the similarity value equals the combined influence of configuration metrics. We have also determined that the control similarity measure outperforms all implementations of the standard measure.},

  abstract = {Converting an image to a set of superpixels is a useful preprocessing step in many computer vision applications; it reduces the dimensionality of the data and removes noise. The most popular superpixels algorithm is the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). To use original SLIC with non-imagery data (for example, rasters of discrete probability distributions, time-series, or matrices describing local texture or pattern), the data needs to be converted to the false-color RGB image constructed from the first three principal components. Here we propose to extend the SLIC algorithm so it can work with non-imagery data structures without data reduction and conversion to the false-color image. The modification allows for using a data distance measure most appropriate to a particular data structure and for using a custom function for averaging values of clusters centers. Comparisons between the extended and original SLIC algorithms in three different mapping tasks are presented and discussed. The results show that the extended SLIC improves the accuracy of the final products in reverse proportion to the percentage of variability explained by the three-dimensional (RGB) approximation to multidimensional non-imagery data. Thus, the largest advantage of using the modified SLIC can be expected in applications to data that cannot be compressed to three dimensions without a significant departure from its original variability.},

Results In this study, we describe the software design of the tool, its capabilities, and present four case studies. They include calculation of spatial signatures based on land cover data for regular and irregular areas, search for regions with similar patterns of geomorphons, detection of changes in land cover patterns, and clustering of areas with similar spatial patterns of land cover and landforms.

This methodology quantifies agreement between any two categorical maps, where either map uses fuzzy or crisp classification. The method measures the agreement at various resolutions by aggregating neighboring cells into an increasingly coarse grid. At each resolution, the method partitions the overall agreement into correct due to chance, correct due to quantity, correct due to location, error due to location, and error due to quantity. In addition, the method computes six statistics that are useful to interpret the differences between maps, and shows how these statistics change with resolution. This technique is particularly useful for characterizing land-cover change and for validating landcover change models. For illustration, this paper applies these theoretical concepts to the validation of a land-use change model for Costa Rica.},

This work scrutinizes binary classes mapped onto regular grids and counts the relative frequencies of all first-order configuration components and then converts these measurements into empirical probabilities of occurrence for either of the two landscape classes. The approach takes into consideration configuration explicitly and composition implicitly (in a common framework), while the construction of a frequency distribution provides a generic model of landscape structure that can be used to simulate structurally similar landscapes or to compare divergence from other landscapes. The technique is first tested on simulated data to characterize a continuum of landscapes across a range of spatial autocorrelations and relative compositions. Subsequent assessments of boundary prominence are explored, where outcomes are known a priori, to demonstrate the utility of this novel method. For a binary map on a regular grid, there are 32 possible configurations of first-order orthogonal neighbours. The goal is to develop a workflow that permits patterns to be characterized in this way and to offer an approach that identifies how relatively divergent observed patterns are, using the well-known Kullback--Leibler divergence.},

The key idea behind CW-SSIM is that certain image distortions lead to consistent phase changes in the local wavelet coefficients, and that a consistent phase shift of the coefficients does not change the structural content of the image. By conducting four case studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the CW-SSIM index against other indices (e.g., Dice, Hausdorff distance) commonly used for assessing the similarity of a given pair of images. In addition, we show that the CW-SSIM index has a number of advantages. It is robust to small rotations and translations. It provides useful comparisons even without a preprocessing image registration step, which is essential for other indices. Moreover, it is computationally less expensive.},

This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarking experiments.},

There are many reasons to compare maps: (i) to detect temporal/spatial changes or hot-spots, (ii) to compare different models, methodologies or scenarios, (iii) to calibrate, validate landuse models, (iv) to analyse model uncertainty and sensitivity, and (v) to assess map accuracy. This paper addresses the quantification of map similarities and dissimilarities using the Map Comparison Kit (MCK) software. Software and documentation are publicly available on the RIKS website free of charge (http://www.riks.nl/MCK/). The main focus is on `categorical' or `nominal' maps. Four different nominal map-comparison techniques are integrated in the software. Maps on ordinal, ratio and interval scale can be dealt with as well. The software is unique in having two map comparison techniques based on fuzzy-set calculation rules. The rationale is that fuzzy-set map comparison is very close to human judgement. Both fuzziness in location and fuzziness in category definitions are dealt with in the software.},

  abstract = {Quite often, geographical analysis involves comparing the spatial distributions of two variables or attributes. A typical method is to calculate the correlation coefficient of the two variables for corresponding areal units. Putting aside the fact that correlation coefficient is aspatial in nature (swapping attribute values between spatial units will not alter the value of correlation coefficient) and the issue of spatial dependency (or the potential existence of spatial autocorrelation) among observations, another major problem with using correlation measures for analyzing spatial data is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), especially with the scale effect. Results from correlation analysis vary with the spatial resolutions based upon which spatial data are gathered. This paper presents an approach for spatial correlation analysis for count variables by comparing their cumulative spatial distributions. Using the concept of cumulative distribution function (CDF) in classical statistics, this paper shows that location-specific CDF (LSCDF) and its associated K-S-like statistic, which indicate the magnitude of difference between the two spatial distributions, are highly consistent over different levels of spatial scale. The application of the LSCDF approach is not restricted to isotropic spatial processes and the statistic provides a rather conservative conclusion. In addition, given any origin to construct LSCDFs, the LSCDFs can provide a geographic description of the two spatial distributions. By combining LSCDFs derived from different origins, a comprehensive understanding of the two distributions for the entire study area is developed. This approach for correlation analysis may offer a direction for future investigation of the MAUP.},
